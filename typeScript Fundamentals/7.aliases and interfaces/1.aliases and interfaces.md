### aliases and interfaces

this is the way that you can give a friendly name to your types.

### aliases

* they help us to define more meaningful name for types 
* they help us in imprting and exporting type modules
* they allows to declare particulars of the type in a single place

when defining aliases, we use title cases. (even lower cases may work but title cases is a     convention ) ex :

    type Person={
        name:string;
        age:number;
    }


scope declaration for an interface is same as that of "let" or "const"
### interfaces

interfaces are ways of defining object types which can be both extended and implemented.

in our aliases folder, we have defined the alias person which we have also used in utils.ts file.

interfaces helpes you define your own **object types**.(not a union or intersection types)

ex : interface Person {
    name:string;
    age:number;
   }

## inhertance with interfaces

we do inheritance in interfaces using two keywords :

    * extends
    * implements

## extending an interface

this works similar to extending a class using extends keyword.
