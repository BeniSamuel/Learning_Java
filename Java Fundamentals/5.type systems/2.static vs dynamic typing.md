there are basically two types of type systems:

* static type system
* dynamic type system

all both system define when type checking will be done.


### static type systems

=> for static type systems, type checking is done at compile time.

examples of static type systems:
 * java
 * c#, c++
 * typescript

### dynamic type systems

    => for dynamic type systems, type checking is done at run time.

    examples of dynamic type systems:
        * javascript
        * python
        * ruby
        * php
