Nominal type systems are all about NAMES. Let’s take a look at a simple Java example:

public class Car {
  String make;
  String model;
  int make;
}
public class CarChecker {
  // takes a `Car` argument, returns a `String`
  public static String printCar(Car car) {  }
}
Car myCar = new Car();
// TYPE CHECKING
// -------------
// Is `myCar` type-equivalent to
//     what `checkCar` wants as an argument?
CarChecker.checkCar(myCar);
In the code above, when considering the question of type equivalence on the last line, all that matters is whether myCar is an instance of the class named Car.

TypeScript type system is structural

Structural type systems are all about STRUCTURE or SHAPE. Let’s look at a TypeScript example:

class Car {
  make: string
  model: string
  year: number
  isElectric: boolean
}
 
class Truck {
  make: string
  model: string
  year: number
  towingCapacity: number
}
 
const vehicle = {
  make: "Honda",
  model: "Accord",
  year: 2017,
}
 
function printCar(car: {
  make: string
  model: string
  year: number
}) {
  console.log(`${car.make} ${car.model} (${car.year})`)
}
 
printCar(new Car()) // Fine
printCar(new Truck()) // Fine
printCar(vehicle) // Fine
Try
The function printCar doesn’t care about which constructor its argument came from, it only cares about whether it has:

A make property that’s of type string
A model property that’s of type string
A year property that’s of type number
If the argument passed to it meets these requirements, printCar is happy.
