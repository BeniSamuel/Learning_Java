### Duck typing
“Duck typing” gets its name from the “duck test”.

“If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quack like a duck, then it probably is a duck”.

In practice, this is very similar to structural typing, but “Duck typing” is usually used to describe dynamic type systems.

### “Strong” vs. “Weak” types
These terms, while used frequently, have no agreed-upon technical definition. In the context of TypeScript it’s common for those who say “strong” to really mean “static”.
